#Reflection

It has been a while since my last meetup, but I do think I had positive experiences for the most part. 

The GirlDevelopIt! Code and Coffee event was much more down-to-earth and personal. It was a great first meetup as it allowed me to talk with programmers on a one-on-one basis. The attendees were polite and welcoming, which was a great atmosphere for a new person to walk into.

The Triangle Open Data Day was large and filled with events and professionals from a wide variety of programming fields. This was a great meetup event to attend in that I got to test my programming knowledge during the programming panels and I got to see professionals at work. I will have to say that the GirlDevelopIt! environment was much more inviting, but it was still great to see people collaborating throughout the Triangle Open Data Day.

Overall, I enjoyed my experiences and think they would definitely serve as useful networking and collaboration events. That said, I am not going to be pursuing a career in programming, so I am not certain I would attend any future GirlDevelopIt! events. The Triangle Open Data Day had some interesting panels focused on data, so I would definitely go to those; however, I would probably not attend the programming and technical panels next time. 

It is great that these groups are available to interested parties and I suppose if I ever have any questions or issues related to programming I could always revisit them.
